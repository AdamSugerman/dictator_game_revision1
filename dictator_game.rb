def dictator_Iraq
  puts "Saddam formally rose to power in 1979, although he had been the de facto head
  of Iraq for several years prior. Within his own country, he suppressed
  his own citizens, particularly the Shi'a and Kurdish people. He also maintained
  power during the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War, and was accused of using
  chemical weapons. To alleviate the threat of revolution, Saddam afforded
  certain benefits to the potentially hostile population. Membership in the
  Ba'ath Party remained open to all Iraqi citizens regardless of background.
  However, repressive measures were taken against its opponents. The major
  instruments for accomplishing this control were the paramilitary and police
  organizations. Saddam was notable for using terror against his own people.
  Saddam's regime was responsible for the deaths of at least 250,000
  Iraqis and committed war crimes in Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. Human
  Rights Watch and Amnesty International issued regular reports of widespread
  imprisonment and torture."

  famine, partially due to economic mismanagement, and had a poor human rights

  of the military by his Songun, or 'military-first', politics. Kim Jong-il
  demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party
  officials with no advice or compromise, and he viewed any slight deviation
  from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty. Kim Jong-il personally directed
  even minor details of state affairs, such as the size of houses for party
  secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates. The state-
  controlled economy of North Korea struggled throughout the 1990s, primarily
  due to mismanagement. In addition, North Korea experienced severe floods in
  the mid-1990s, exacerbated by poor land management. This, compounded with the
  fact that only 18% of North Korea is arable land and the country's inability
  to import the goods necessary to sustain industry, led to a severe famine and

  played. Being a very private man he gave the order that no person should
  enter his bed chambers on pain of death. Later, while in his chambers he
  decided to test whether his guards had listened to this instruction.
  Pretending to scream in pain, he called for the guards stationed outside
  the door. Fearing that their leader was in trouble the guards burst into
  the room. Stalin had them executed for failing to follow his standing orders.
  This little prank soon backfired, however, when Stalin suffered a seizure
  while alone in his bedroom. The guards were too afraid to enter, finding
  him hours later laid in a puddle of stale urine. He died three days later."

  January Turkmenbashi, which means Father of the Turkmen, a name he gave
  himself. He also 'legislated' the renaming of the days of the week to ones
  that translate to 'Young Day', 'Spirituality Day', etc. He even renamed the
  word 'bread', Gurbansoltan, after his own mother. Niyazov outlawed beards on
  men and cosmetics on TV anchors, and prohibited both chewing tobacco and lip-
  syncing on Turkmenistan soil. In a society of smokers, Niyazov recommended
  that people chew on bones, which he argued would strengthen their teeth. He
  authored a book, the Book of the Soul, and ordered students in schools and
  mosques to read and study it, and in the case of mosques, to give it equal
  respect to the Quran (and if not, the mosque would be demolished). To get a
  driver's license, people had to memorize the contents of the book. Finally,
  Niyazov told everyone that he had made a pact with G-d that anyone who read
  his book three times would go to heaven. In 2005, he ordered a copy of his
  book to be sent to outer space."
